# Probabilistic Graph Model

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a probabilistic graph model using logistic regression to predict connections between vertices based on their attributes and interconnections. The model uses a logistic function to estimate the probability that a given pair of vertices in the graph will connect.

## Mathematical Model

### Main Equation:
The probability of a connection between two vertices \(i\) and \(j\) is modeled using the following logistic function:

$$
\text{prob\_of\_vertex}_{i,j} = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-(\alpha*|i| + \beta*|j| + \sigma)}
$$

## Workflow

1. **Initialization**:
   - **n**: Number of vertices in the graph.

2. **Connection Estimation**:
   - Utilize the logistic function defined above to determine the probability of a connection between any two vertices \(i\) and \(j\).

3. **Convergence Criteria**:
   - Monitor and define convergence criteria for the model, which might be based on changes in parameter estimates or stability of the graph's structure over iterations.

4. **Parameter Estimation**:
   - Evaluate the fit of these parameters to check the model's effectiveness.

5. **Iterative Refinement**:
   - Expand the model iteratively by incorporating additional parameters from connected vertices. This includes vertices directly connected to either \(i\) or \(j\), as well as their respective connections.
   - Iterate this process, enhancing the model complexity by increasing the order \(p\) of connections considered, up to a maximum of \(p \leq 4\).
