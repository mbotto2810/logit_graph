# Probabilistic Graph Model

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a probabilistic graph model using logistic regression to predict connections between vertices based on their attributes and interconnections. The model employs a logistic function to estimate the probability of connection between any given pair of vertices in the graph.

## Repository Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains the notebooks used to generate the results in the paper.
- `src/`: Contains the source code of the model.
- `data/`: Contains the datasets used in the experiments.
